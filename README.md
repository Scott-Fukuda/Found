Found is a forum where users can post lost items and other users can create requests to retrieve said items. When a user finds a lost item, they can create a "found post".
Users can navigate to the "found post" tab, where they will be prompted with several questions about the item they've found. This post is then added to a database of posts.
When another other user realizes they've lost an item, they can submit a "lost request" containing information about their lost item. This "lost request" is matched up against the
different "found posts" and the "found posts" that match certain specifications are displayed to the user. This acts as a security measure against malicious users attempting
to claim items that do not belong to them. Once a user identifies their lost item, they can claim this item and recieve information about where it is located. As additional
security measures, users can only make 3 "lost requests" per week, and each user can only create an account with a Cornell email through Google login.
